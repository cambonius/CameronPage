                <h3 class="mb-0 text-center">Design Project #1: Introduction to 3D Printing</h3>
                <h3 class="mb-0">Objective</h3>
                <p>The goal of this project was to introduce the fundamentals of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and
                    Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) through hands-on experience with a <b>Prusa MINI+ 3D Printer</b>
                    and <b>PrusaSlicer software</b>. The project was divided into three parts:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Creating and printing a customized nameag</b> using PrusaSlicer </li>
                    <li><b>Printing a second, more challenging test print</b> (a torture test) to explore the limits of
                        3D printing.</li>
                    <li><b>Documenting the process on a personal website</b> to reflect on the learning experience.
                </ol>
                <p>By completing this project, I gained the ability to slice and print 3D models, understand the
                    <b>technical constraints of additive manufacturing</b>, and improve <b>troubleshooting
                        techniques</b> for common 3D printing issues.

                        <li><b>Second nametag:</b> The text was less distinct, likely due to the <b>font size being too

                        <li><b> Future imporvments:</b> I should increase the font size and consider <b>pausing the

                <p>
                    The goal of Project #2 was to remix existing 3D models by combining elements from different designs,
                    modifying them using 3D modeling software, and printing the final models. This project was divided
                    into two parts: using TinkerCad for remixing and using Fusion360 for more advanced modifications.
                    The objective was to explore 3D modeling, enhance design skills, and gain hands-on experience with
                    3D printing processes.

                <p><b>Concept & Design Process</b></p>
                <p>
                    For the first part of this project, I decided to recreate a visual representation of my <a
                        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/58fc0o/a_horse_is_sitting_at_home_watching_mtv/">favorite
                        joke </a> âA horse walks into a bar. The bartender says, âWhy the long face?'â To bring this
                    concept to life, I planned to combine a horse model with a bar model using TinkerCad. I initially
                    sketched out my design, but I found that my proportions were off because I started with
                    the horse rather than defining the 3D environment first. To streamline the process, I opted to
                    download an .stl file of Moeâs Tavern from <i>The Simpsons</i> as my bar model, which allowed me to
                    focus on placing the horse correctly within the scene.

                    <li><b>Alignment & Scaling</b>: Initially, I had difficulty positioning the horse inside the tavern
                        because my snap grid was set to 1mm. After turning the snap grid off, I gained finer control
                        over object placement.</li>
                    <li><b>Modifications</b>: To ensure a proper fit, I adjusted the scale of the horse and tweaked the
                        dimensions of the tavernâs doorway. I also removed unnecessary walls and adjusted the modelâs
                        orientation for printing efficiency.</li>
                    <li><b>Grouping & Exporting</b>: Once I finalized the positioning, I grouped the elements in
                        TinkerCad and exported the final .stl file.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>3D Printing Process</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Importing to PrusaSlicer</b>: I imported the .stl file into PrusaSlicer and adjusted the
                        scale slightly to fit within the printerâs build volume.</li>
                    <li><b>Support Structures</b>: Since the design had overhanging parts, I added support structures to
                        ensure the printâs structural integrity.</li>
                    <li><b>Printing</b>: I initiated the print and monitored the process for any errors or warping.</li>
                    <li><b>Post-Processing</b>: After printing, I removed the supports carefully. However, I noticed
                        some rough edges where the supports had been attached. More precise removal tools or finer
                        support settings in PrusaSlicer could have improved the post-processing quality.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>Resluts and Observations</b></p>
                <p>
                    The final print successfully represented the joke, with the horse positioned within the bar. The
                    overall print quality was satisfactory, though I could have optimized the support removal process to
                    reduce imperfections. Additionally, adjusting the modelâs orientation before slicing could have
                    improved print efficiency and reduced filament waste.

                <p><b>Concept & Design Process</b></p>
                <p>
                    For the second part of the project, I decided to create a functional, auto-opening PokÃ©Ball. I found
                    inspiration from a<a
                        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1cyjzkr/made_this_3dprintable_autoopening_pok%C3%A9_ball/">
                        Reddit post </a> that had a similar design and chose to personalize it by adding my nickname,
                    "Cam," to the top half of the PokÃ©Ball.
                </p>
                <p><b>Fusion360 Modeling Process</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Importing .stl Files</b>: I downloaded the PokÃ©Ball model components from the aformentioned
                        tutorial.</li>
                    <li><b>Design Adjustments</b>: Initially, I attempted to assemble multiple components in Fusion360
                        but faced difficulties in merging them effectively. Based on advice from Ben and Ian, I shifted
                        my approach to modifying a single component rather than assembling multiple parts.</li>
                    <li><b>Mesh Conversion</b>: To engrave my name into the top of the PokÃ©Ball, I first had to convert
                        the imported mesh into a solid body.</li>
                    <li><b>Adding the Name</b>: Using Fusion360âs text tool and following an online tutorial, I debossed
                        my nickname "Cam" into the surface of the top half of the PokÃ©Ball. While I originally
                        considered an embossed design, I found the debossed look more aesthetically pleasing and easier
                        to print.</li>
                    <li><b>Exporting</b>: After finalizing the modifications, I exported the modified .stl file for
                        printing.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>3D Printing Process</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Importing to PrusaSlicer</b>: I imported the modeified .stl file into PrusaSlicer and added
                        supports for the overhanging sections.</li>
                    <li><b>Printing the Top Half</b>: The print quality was good overall, but the very top of the
                        PokÃ©Ball's hemisphere did not print completely. Thankfully, this issue was minimal and did not
                        impact the functionality of the PokÃ©Ball.</li>
                    <li><b>Printing the Other Components</b>: I proceeded to print the remaining components and followed
                        the assembly steps outlined in the tutorial.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>Resluts and Observations</b></p>
                <p>
                    The final product was a fully functional PokÃ©Ball that opens and closes with a button press. The
                    debossed name on the top half turned out well, adding a unique, personal touch to the design. The
                    minor issue with the top hemisphere could have been avoided by slightly increasing the infill
                    percentage or adjusting the print orientation.

                            <p class="text-center">To begin the design process for the chassis enclosure, my partner,
                                Vivian, and I brainstormed potential concepts. Vivian proposed a race car theme, which I
                                refined to model the enclosure after Lightning McQueen from Pixarâs Cars franchise.
                                Given the complexity of modeling in Fusion360, I initiated the modeling process on
                                February 13 to allow lots of time for refinement. Initially, I followed a <a
                                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voB4ggW-Gfg">tutorial</a> to guide the
                                modeling process. The first step, which involved adding reference canvases in Fusion360,
                                was beneficial. However, the remainder of the tutorial proved ineffective, as the
                                resulting model failed to print correctly when converted to .3mf or .stl format. When
                                sliced in PrusaSlicer, only support structures were generated, indicating an issue with
                                model thickness. Attempts to add thickness resulted in the error message: âThe operation
                                could not create a valid result. Try adjusting the values or changing the input
                                geometry.â The modelâs geometry was too complex to modify effectively, necessitating a
                                complete restart. After further research, I located another tutorial that utilized the
                                Chevrolet Corvette C6 orthographic diagrams as reference canvases; the same car model
                                that inspired Lightning McQueenâs design. Following <a
                                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyqQtLjt_WM">this tutorial</a>, I successfully
                                progressed through the initial steps until approximately the twelve-and-a-half-minute
                                mark. At this stage, I encountered difficulties in creating accurate wheel holes due to
                                differences in geometry between the tutorial model and my own. To address this
                                challenge, I employed extruded cylinders to form the wheel holes, which proved to be an
                                effective solution. After successfully incorporating this adjustment, I was able to
                                extend the thickness of the car model without errors. The final model was successfully
                                generated and appears as shown in the following image. I saved the .stl file and
                                exported it to TinkerCad, where I could make more simple extrusions for the window
                                shield, and McQueenâs signature number â95â on each side of the car. Then, I exported
                                the .stl file to PrusaSlicer to scale it based on the measurements done in class and was
                                about to slice it to make supports...</p>

                            <p class="text-center">Upon further evaluation, Vivian and I identified several design
                                issues with the chassis enclosure. The enclosure obstructed access to the battery
                                compartment and power button, and the carâs spoiler contained unnecessary geometry.
                                However, we determined that these issues could be effectively addressed through
                                additional modifications. To implement these adjustments, we utilized TinkerCad to
                                create targeted extrusions. First, we modified the front window by converting it into a
                                complete extrusion, allowing users to access and remove the batteries. Next, we added a
                                rotated cube extrusion at the rear of the car to provide access to the power button.
                                Finally, we introduced a cylindrical extrusion to eliminate the unnecessary geometry in
                                the spoiler. These modifications successfully resolved the identified issues while
                                maintaining the integrity of the overall design.</p>

                                a solid starting point, it was not the correct size. The model was too short and lacked
                                sufficient width, and the wheel holes did not extend over the body of the car as
                                intended. To address these issues, Vivian and I adjusted the modelâs dimensions based on
                                the tailored box (yellow) we had created. We increased the modelâs length and width by a
                                few millimeters, ensuring that it was wider and slightly shorter than the yellow box.
                                However, modifying the height presented a challenge, as any adjustments risked
                                distorting the proportions of the wheel-hole overhangs.</p>

                                TinkerCad. Initially, the design appeared unrefined due to an overhanging section of
                                excess material. To address this issue, we added a 2mm-wide semicircle to each
                                overhanging section, effectively minimizing its visibility. Satisfied with the revised
                                design, we proceeded with the standard preparation process. We inverted the model,
                                generated the necessary support structures, and initiated the second iteration of the
                                Lightning McQueen print.</p>

                                determined that the printed modelâs actual length was shorter than the dimensions
                                specified in the computer model. This discrepancy was likely due to the endpoints being
                                positioned at the spoiler. To correct this issue, we established a new target length
                                based on precise measurements. Using a digital caliper, we measured the actual length of
                                the tailored box (109.71 mm), the intended input length for the second print (108.54
                                mm), and the actual length of the second print (106.48 mm). We then calculated the
                                adjusted input length using the following equation: New Input Length=109.71 mm+108.54
                                mmâ106.48 mm=111.77 mm This revised length was used as the new input dimension for the
                                next iteration of the print.</p>

                            <p class="text-center">The third print somewhat successfully addressed the length
                                discrepancy, aligning with the intended dimensions for width and height, and while not
                                perfect regarding length, it could still fit well enough for the chassis to function.
                                The modelâs width and height remained consistent with the tailored box, and the wheel
                                holes extended over the body of the car as intended. The revised design partially
                                resolved the initial issues, resulting in a mostly functional and aesthetically pleasing
                                chassis enclosure. This outcome demonstrates the importance of precise measurements and
                                iterative adjustments in the design process.</p>

                            <p class="text-center">Just like Vivian and I did with the 3D printed chassis enclosure, we
                                began making our laser-cut chassis enclosure by brainstorming ideas for what we would
                                make. After some thought, we settled on designing a <a
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_home">mobile house</a>. We sketched out
                                how we would design it, agreeing on by making a wooden box reminiscent of the one in the
                                tutorial, then adding two triangles to serve as a way to hang the roof panels, and, of
                                course, two roof panels. </p>

                            <p class="text-center">Our first laser cut (not pictured) was supposed to look like this,
                                but when we tried to scale in Fusion360 to match the chassisâ perimiter, it messed up
                                the scale of the connecting joints and holes, so we could not connect it. To fix this,
                                we decided to remake the chassis box in Fusion360, except this time, instead of directly
                                following the tutorial's measurements, we would use our measurements of the chassis.
                                This method proved to be effective, as our new box could now be properly assembled. </p>

                            <p class="text-center">We only had one minor problem remaining, that problem being the fact
                                that our roof panels were too long. We concluded that the best way to fix this would be
                                to make a line in LightBurn to cut the unneded 'tiles'. After the cut, we were able to
                                successfully assemble the full house and put it onto the chassis (pictured).</p>
