                <p>On January 21, 2025, when I learned that the class would be about 3D printing, I was extremely
                    excited, as I already knew how to 3D print using Prusa Mini and PrusaSlicer via the MakerLab. Last
                    semester, I spent a lot of time in the MakerLab 3D printing random paraphernalia, and it was a lot
                    of fun. Since most of this class would be about discovering how to use the PrusaSlicer and 3D print
                    using the Prusa mini, I helped some of my classmates with both the software and hardware. When I was
                    able to get a printer to print my (second) nametag, I went a bit too fast, likely because of my
                    excitement and overconfidence in 3D printing that I got some filament stuck in the extruder tube.
                    Whoops. Thankfully, Ian was able to help release the filament. After that, I worked with a different
                    roll of PLA filament to print my second name tag (left), and after heating the nozzle & plate,
                    purging the previous roll’s filament, and loading the filament & USB with my 3mf file I would be
                    using, it came out as seen on the image on the left. In my opinion, it did not come out as complete
                    as my first nametag (the nametag on the right), mainly the text of my name, likely because I set the
                    text to be too small. I also did not change the color/filament of the top layer. Next time, I should
                    slow down and take a breath before I move forward with each step.</p>

                <p>Following the debatably successful print of my second nametag that I definitely did not recycle at
                    the end of class, it was time to print out a 3D torture test. Thankfully we were allowed to take one
                    off of a 3D modeling website, so I grabbed a <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622">
                        classic toy boat torture test</a> off Thingiverse, which is a relief because I do not know how
                    to model a torture test from scratch. I downloaded the .zip file which included a 3mf file as well
                    as an STL file (.3mf is a modern file format that can include information about materials, colors,
                    and textures, while .stl is an older format that only supports basic geometry). Once the .3mf file
                    was downloaded, I uploaded it to the PrusaSlicer and was about to add supports to it before getting
                    the gcode, but Ben & Ian told me that would take away the whole point of the torture test. Once I
                    got the GCode downloaded and on a USB drive, I uploaded it to the PrusaMini and the 3D printing
                    began. I was not able to watch the print because the class was just about over and I had to go to a
                    meeting at noon, but I was able to do some research on the toy boat torture test. Following my
                    research, I realized it is considered a "torture test" because it is designed with features like
                    overhangs, bridges, and acute angles, which challenge the PrusaMini and other 3d printer's
                    capabilities and reveal any potential weaknesses in its printing quality. Luckily, when I came back
                    from the meeting and picked up my print (as seen in the image above), it was a successful print!</p>

                <p>After my first two 3d prints of the class. I was told I needed to publish them on a GitHub website.
                    As it turns out, I already know how to work with GitHub thanks to COSI 116a: Information
                    Visualization, so I was able to quickly set up a GitHub page so working with GitHub turned out to
                    not be a problem. I downloaded this <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume"> template</a>
                    and played around with it, mainly adding an introduction tab as well as an ENGR 11a tab, where I can
                    incorporate my homework submissions, which turned out to be pretty simple for me with my computer
                    science background. That is not to say there were zero problems, though, as I wanted to go above and
                    beyond and upload my work to a domain with my name. I made a major blunder and bought a domain name
                    on GoDaddy, which offers terrible domain management. It took me a while to transfer my GitHub page
                    to GoDaddy, and it was incredibly frustrating, but once I did, I got another error message! Upon
                    doing research as to why I got the message, I realized that I needed to purchase an SSL certificate.
                    Ugh! I caved in and bought a cheap one, and it STILL didn’t work, which left me really mad. I was so
                    mad, but still determined to get my domain name that a few days later, I made the switch to
                    NameCheap. It was a lot cheaper than GoDaddy, and it worked this time! Now, cameron-sherman.com is
                    finally live and I can feel satisfied.</p>
